Simple app to show weather for 5 days. It's using _openweathermap_ api for getting weather forecast for next 5 days, and _locationiq_ api for searching given city locations. App is not finished (obviously), but I'd like to talk about it's shortcomings and chosen solutions.

Create .env file with:

REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=c3203bc23f216bdea74876f467eb01a1
REACT_APP_GEOCODING_API=pk.8dd6b3ac1478a8dad37264d0651b8ccd

`git checkout final` for commit before weekend, when I was expected to finish. All commits after that will be for me, to make the app look and behave better (if I find the time).

`yarn` to install all dependencies
`yarn start` to start the app
